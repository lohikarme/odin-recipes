        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>First sojourn into making espresso at home, I wanted to not get in over my head, but still have the required equipment for a minimum viable product.</p>
            <p>Searching for secondhand equipment turned up nothing at the time, so I ordered the most inexpensive espresso machine and quality hand grinders available. This search lead me to the leaver arm espresso "machine" niche zero, and the made by knock aregrind.</p>
            <p>The niche zero has treated me well and continues to make delicious espresso, though heat management is finicky.</p>
            <p>The aregrind on the other hand has been abused. This device is intended for a courser grind destined for its namesake aeropress, though can easily grind for espresso. The markings on the device are a saviour for dialing in, though the accuracy and precision are not present at these finer grinds. Not only is it too sensitive for nailing espresso, the device will wander while grinding. This is ignoring the aluminum power I can find on my hands after use....To be fair, this is a great device that deserves to be retired with full honours before the wheels completely fall off. </p>
